### Hello people üëã

I'm jogibear9988

I spend many of my development time to work on Open Source Projects in Typescript and C#. My main Project at the moment is a HTML Designer Framework (https://github.com/node-projects/web-component-designer).

I started my first Open Source Library (https://github.com/dotnetprojects/DotNetSiemensPLCToolBoxLibrary) in January 2011, at first at CodePlex. It is a Library for Communcation with Siemens PLC's and Step 7 Project files. I'm still workin on this this days.

Since then, I've worked on many Open Source Project on Github...

 - I'm the maintainer of the Sharp Develop WPF Designer Project [WpfDesigner](https://github.com/icsharpcode/WpfDesigner).
 - I'm a maintainer of [linq2db](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db), the fastest linq provider for .NET
 - I started the organization [iobroker-community-adapters](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters), wich provides extensions for the NodeJS IOT framework ioBroker
 - I forked many projects wich were stopped development and fixed bugs or increased functions, for example [esprima-next](https://github.com/node-projects/esprima-next), [WpfToolkit](https://github.com/dotnetprojects/WpfToolkit), [WpfextendedToolkit](https://github.com/dotnetprojects/WpfExtendedToolkit), ...
 - I created an organization to work on .NET projects: https://github.com/dotnetprojects
 - I created an organization to work on NodeJS/Javscript Projects: https://github.com/node-projects

and much more...
TypeScript, Polymer, DotNet-Runtime, WPF, NodeJS, ioBroker, esprima, AngleSharp, webcomponents-manifest, fec, avalondock, ...

At least I also migrated many WPF Librarys to github before the shutdown of Codeplex. These you could all find at my private github account.
